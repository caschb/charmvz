This library uses the [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) project manager. It can be installed using your system's package manager.

Once `uv` is installed you can run

`uv build`

And it will automatically create the `.whl` file that can be installed in you environment with `uv`, `pip` or any other package manager.
